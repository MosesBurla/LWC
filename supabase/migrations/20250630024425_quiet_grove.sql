/*
  # Fix RLS policies to prevent infinite recursion

  1. Security Changes
    - Remove recursive policies that cause infinite loops
    - Create safer admin policies using auth.jwt() claims
    - Simplify user access policies
    - Fix circular dependencies in policy checks

  2. Policy Updates
    - Users table: Remove admin check that queries same table
    - Groups table: Simplify admin access
    - Events table: Remove problematic admin policies
    - Other tables: Update to prevent recursion
